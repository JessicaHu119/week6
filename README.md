workshop

There is no conflicts

make a conflict :)

##Task7
In this week's workflow, I have a total of 9 files/folders.

The Rproj. user folder contains the paths to many of the files I use when writing code, and it will be updated as I update the code, but I don't open it to use it.

The data folder contains the pics folder and a few other files. The pics folder contains images of the six fish species in the data for this study. 'OA_activitydat_20190302_BIOL3207.csv' is the original data file that we used for the data analysis using R. It is from the article "Clark, T.D. et al. in 2020" Ocean acidification does not impair the behaviour of coral reef fishes".

There is a data folder in the output folder that I tried to copy the 'OA_activitydat_20190302_BIOL3207.csv' into in task. Another figure folder contains the box plots I made for the different points of the six fishes with pictures of the fish in them.

.Rhistory is a history of my writing of R. It will be updated automatically as I write R. It is similar to an automatic backup of R.

.gitignore contains the paths to some of the files I use when working with R code.

The README file is used in Task 7 to try out conflicts. When my contributor and I edit and upload the same file in the same place, GitHub saves both of our changes and shows the conflict. Once I decided which changes were best and removed the conflict markers, the conflict was resolved.

The git_fishes_student.rmd file is the code I wrote for this workshop, and the git_fishes_student.html file is the web page result of the knit of the git_fishes_student.rmd file.

Finally, workshop6.Rproj is the RStudio working environment I used to edit the R code this time.
