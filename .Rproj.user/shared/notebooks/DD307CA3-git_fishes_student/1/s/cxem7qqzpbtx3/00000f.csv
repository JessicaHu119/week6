"0","##  GitHub is not a very good backup, it doesn't automatically back up my updates in real time. Whenever I make a change, I have to manually go to GitHub Desktop to update it and then upload it to the web version. Also, it doesn't keep every version of my changes. In summary, we can't rely on GitHub as a backup."
